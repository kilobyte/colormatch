This is a playground for various ways to convert between RGB and 16- and
256-color palettes with as little error as possible, using CIEDE2000 and
other metrics.

Executables here:
 * nearest256: compute the optimal RGB->256 table
 * xterm256: compute the RGB->256 table using √(dist²)
 (a bunch of other alternatives not in git that suck, like the adalyah method)
 * rate: find avg² and worst error of a RGB->256 table

 * 16x16: print CIEDE2000 distances between 16 VGA colors
